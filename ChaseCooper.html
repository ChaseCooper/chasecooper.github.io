Hello, my name is Chase Cooper. I was born August 17, 1997.

I am currently majoring in Risk Management and Insurance and I am thinking about double majoring in Real Estate as well.

<strong style="color:red">
Outside of my classes I have tried to get involved in several student organizations here on campus.
I am a Christian, so I have geared my student involvement toward my faith through campus and student led ministries.
The two largest ones that I am a part of are Cru and Wesley.
Below I explain my involvement within the two in further detail.

With Cru my involvement began even before I came to college. I was contacted over the summer and informed that Cru was looking for musicians. I play the drums so I thought that this would be an awesome opportunity to me continue with that after high school. Once I arrived here I had a short audition and became a member of the Cru Worship Team. Other than playing drums in the band I have gotten involved in a small group that meets once a week and is led by older guys.
Here we discuss things in further detail for the upcomming weekly meeting, which is on Tuesdays at 8:00pm in the Memorial Hall Ballroom. Cru offers many outreach programs that stem from here on campus to around the world through the Summer Mission program.
As I go throughout my college carrer I plan on continuing my involvement with Cru and experiencing all they have to offer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a HREF="http://www.cruuga.org/">Cru Website</a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:14pt">
My involvement in Wesley is not nearly as extensive as in Cru, but it is something that I am a part of and that I enjoy. Wesley at UGA offers a program on Monday nights at 8:00pm called Freshley, which is a service geared directly toward Freshmen.
Here we sing a few songs at the beginning and then listen to a short message. After the message we break off into small groups much like the one at Cru to discuss the message in further detail.
